# Towers_Exercise

Algorithm for solving the Tower of Hanoi.

Executing the file "tower_of_hanoi" will showcase the solution through prints.

Executing the file "tower_of_hanoi_with_visual" will demonstrate the solution with an animation created using pygame.

Both files accept a single command line argument, determining the number of disks in the problem. The specified number must be an integer greater than 0.
